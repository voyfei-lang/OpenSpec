# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Report privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/security/advisories/new). Please don't open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability.

Include what you can: affected version, reproduction steps, and the impact you believe it has. We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days and to ship a fix or a decision within 30 days. Valid reports are credited in the advisory unless you'd rather stay anonymous.

## Supported versions

Fixes ship in the latest published version on npm. Older versions are not patched — upgrade to pick up a fix.

## Threat model

OpenSpec is a local command-line tool. It has no server, no network listener, and no privileged daemon. It reads and writes markdown under the directory you run it in, using paths you supply, with your own user permissions. It can offer to upgrade itself during `openspec update`, and only with your say-so. It sends anonymous usage telemetry, which you can disable with `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0`.

That shapes what is and isn't a vulnerability here:

| In scope | Out of scope |
| --- | --- |
| Code execution triggered by parsing a spec, config, or template file | Reading or writing a file path you passed to the CLI yourself |
| Escaping the directory OpenSpec was pointed at, via untrusted input | Static-analysis findings on file-path joins with no untrusted input |
| Leaking credentials or file contents through telemetry or logs | Vulnerabilities in devDependencies that don't ship in the published package |
| Prototype pollution or injection reachable from a config or spec file | Denial of service against your own machine using your own input |

If you think something sits on the boundary, report it and we'll work it out together.

## Published package contents

The `openspec` npm package publishes `dist/`, `bin/`, and `schemas/`. Build and test tooling (vite, rollup, vitest, eslint, and their transitive dependencies) is not published. Scanners that read `pnpm-lock.yaml` without separating dependency scope will report advisories for packages that never reach an installed copy of OpenSpec.

You do not have to take that on trust — install the package and look:

```sh
npm install @fission-ai/openspec
ls node_modules | grep -E '^(vite|rollup|vitest|eslint|js-yaml|minimatch)$'   # no matches
```

`pnpm audit --prod` in this repository reports the same scope, and CI runs it on every pull request.

## What the CLI does on your machine

| Surface | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Install scripts | The package ships no `preinstall`, `install`, or `postinstall` script, so installing it from the npm registry runs no code from OpenSpec. (`prepare` is still declared; npm runs it only for git and local-directory installs, where it builds from source.) Shell completions are opt-in via `openspec completion install`; the CLI prints a one-line tip about them on its first run. |
| Running other programs | Every call that goes through a shell uses a fixed literal (`which gh`, `gh auth status`). Anything carrying your input — issue text, editor paths, workset commands, the path passed to `openspec update` — uses an argument array, never string interpolation into a shell. On Windows, `.cmd` shims are launched through `cross-spawn`, which escapes arguments rather than concatenating them. |
| Installing software | `openspec update` can run `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest` and then re-run `openspec update` with the upgraded CLI. It does this only after you answer yes to a prompt, only for the OpenSpec package itself, only when npm owns the install, and never in CI or a non-interactive shell. A global install lives outside your project, so it runs with your permissions there and executes whatever lifecycle scripts the published package ships. It then reads the installed binary's version back rather than assuming the upgrade took. Decline and it prints the command for you to run yourself. |
| Telemetry | Command name, OpenSpec version, and a locally generated random UUID. No file paths, no file contents, no environment, no hostname, and IP capture is explicitly disabled. Opt out with `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`; it is off in CI automatically. |
| Network | Telemetry when enabled, and one npm registry request during `openspec update` to check whether a newer CLI has been published. That request sends no data about you beyond what any HTTP request reveals, runs once per `openspec update` with nothing cached, and is skipped when `CI` is set to anything but an explicit off-value, under `NODE_ENV=test`, or when `OPENSPEC_NO_UPDATE_CHECK`, `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`, or `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` is set. Reading, writing, and validating specs is entirely local. |

## Automated checks

| Tool | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [CodeQL](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/security/code-scanning) | Static analysis on every push and pull request to `main` |
| [Dependabot](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/security/dependabot) | Dependency advisories plus weekly update pull requests for the CLI, the docs site, and CI actions |
| Dependency review | Blocks a pull request that introduces a high-severity dependency |
| Secret scanning | Enabled on the repository, including push protection |
| `pnpm audit` | Published dependencies are audited on every pull request, on pushes to `main`, and weekly. Advisory on pull requests so an unrelated change is not blocked; failing elsewhere, so a new advisory surfaces even when no dependency changed. Build tooling is always advisory. |
| Pinned actions | Every GitHub Action runs from a commit SHA, so a moved tag cannot change what CI executes |

Alerts are triaged against the threat model above, so a finding in build-only tooling is fixed on the normal update cadence rather than treated as an incident.
