Sync delta specs from a change to main specs.

This is an **agent-driven** operation - you will read delta specs and directly edit main specs to apply the changes. This allows intelligent merging (e.g., adding a scenario without copying the entire requirement).

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show changes that have delta specs (under `specs/` directory).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Resolve change context**

   Run:
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```

   The JSON includes `planningHome.root`. Main specs live under `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/` — use that (store-aware) root for every main-spec path below, not a hardcoded repo path. When a store is selected it points at the store, not the current repository.

3. **Find delta specs**

   Use `artifactPaths.specs.existingOutputPaths` from the status JSON as the list of delta spec files.

   Each delta spec file contains sections like:
   - `## ADDED Requirements` - New requirements to add
   - `## MODIFIED Requirements` - Changes to existing requirements
   - `## REMOVED Requirements` - Requirements to remove
   - `## RENAMED Requirements` - Requirements to rename (FROM:/TO: format)

   If no delta specs found, inform user and stop.

4. **For each delta spec, apply changes to main specs**

   For each capability delta spec path returned by the CLI (these may belong to a selected store, not the repo):

   a. **Read the delta spec** to understand the intended changes

   b. **Read the main spec** at `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (may not exist yet)

   c. **Apply changes intelligently**:

      **ADDED Requirements:**
      - If requirement doesn't exist in main spec → add it
      - If requirement already exists → update it to match (treat as implicit MODIFIED)

      **MODIFIED Requirements:**
      - Find the requirement in main spec
      - Apply the changes - this can be:
        - Adding new scenarios (don't need to copy existing ones)
        - Modifying existing scenarios
        - Changing the requirement description
      - Preserve scenarios/content not mentioned in the delta

      **REMOVED Requirements:**
      - Remove the entire requirement block from main spec

      **RENAMED Requirements:**
      - Find the FROM requirement, rename to TO

      **`## Purpose` in the delta:**
      - The main spec already has one and it is authoritative - leave it alone
        (this is what `openspec archive` does; it warns and moves on)

   d. **Create new main spec** if capability doesn't exist yet:
      - Create `<planningHome.root>/openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
      - Add Purpose section: copy the delta's `## Purpose` body verbatim when it has one
        (this is what `openspec archive` does); only write a brief TBD placeholder when it does not
      - Add Requirements section with the ADDED requirements
      - Follow the **Main Spec Format Reference** below

5. **Show summary**

   After applying all changes, summarize:
   - Which capabilities were updated
   - What changes were made (requirements added/modified/removed/renamed)
   - Any new main spec left with a TBD Purpose placeholder, so it gets written
     now rather than lingering

**Delta Spec Format Reference**

```markdown
## Purpose

Only on a delta that introduces a brand-new capability. Seeds the new main spec.

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Existing Feature
#### Scenario: New scenario to add
- **WHEN** user does A
- **THEN** system does B

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Deprecated Feature

## RENAMED Requirements

- FROM: `### Requirement: Old Name`
- TO: `### Requirement: New Name`
```

**Main Spec Format Reference**

Main specs are what the delta merges INTO. They must never contain delta operation headers (`## ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED Requirements`) - after syncing, every requirement lives under a single `## Requirements` section:

```markdown
# <capability> Specification

## Purpose
Short description of what this capability does and why it exists.

## Requirements

### Requirement: New Feature
The system SHALL do something new.

#### Scenario: Basic case
- **WHEN** user does X
- **THEN** system does Y
```

**Key Principle: Intelligent Merging**

Unlike programmatic merging, you can apply **partial updates**:
- To add a scenario, just include that scenario under MODIFIED - don't copy existing scenarios
- The delta represents *intent*, not a wholesale replacement
- Use your judgment to merge changes sensibly

**Output On Success**

```markdown
## Specs Synced: <change-name>

Updated main specs:

**<capability-1>**:
- Added requirement: "New Feature"
- Modified requirement: "Existing Feature" (added 1 scenario)

**<capability-2>**:
- Created new spec file
- Added requirement: "Another Feature"

Main specs are now updated. The change remains active - archive when implementation is complete.
```

**Guardrails**
- Read both delta and main specs before making changes
- Preserve existing content not mentioned in delta
- Never copy a delta file into a main spec as-is - merge its content so the main spec keeps the Main Spec Format Reference structure, with no delta operation headers
- If something is unclear, ask for clarification
- Show what you're changing as you go
- The operation should be idempotent - running twice should give same result
