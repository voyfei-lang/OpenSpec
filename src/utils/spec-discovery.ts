 * matching the historical requirement that specs live in a capability folder.
 * Dot-directories are skipped and symlinked directories are not followed.
 * A symlinked `spec.md` IS resolved: `hasAnyFileUnder` and the artifact
 * graph's globs both count it as content, so dropping it here would silently
 * lose the delta on archive; a dangling link is skipped. Results are sorted
 * by id for deterministic output.
 *
 * A missing root (ENOENT) yields an empty list, but any other read failure
 * (EACCES, EIO, ...) is thrown rather than swallowed: since this feeds the
 * archive/apply merge path, silently dropping an unreadable capability would
 * recreate the exact data-loss class #1353 is closing.

 * True when any regular non-dot file exists anywhere under the given

 * anything there would be silently dropped or misread while the change claims
 * to have nothing. Dot entries (.DS_Store, .gitkeep, dot-directories) are

 * (without being followed): the artifact graph's globs follow them, so a
 * symlinked spec would read as existing content while the change claims to
 * have none - it contradicts the marker like any regular file. A missing
 * directory returns false; other read failures are thrown for the caller to
