/**
 * Command Invocation
 *
 * How a tool spells an OpenSpec command has two parts, and only one of them
 * can be read off the file the adapter writes:
 *
 * - The *name* comes from the file. `.../commands/opsx/<id>.md` is namespaced
 *   by its directory, so the tool registers `opsx:<id>` (Claude Code, Gemini,
 *   Crush, ...). `.../commands/opsx-<id>.md` names the command with the
 *   filename, so the tool registers `opsx-<id>` (Cursor, GitHub Copilot,
 *   OpenCode, ...).
 * - The *prefix* is the tool's own and cannot be derived. Almost every tool
 *   uses `/`; Amazon Q loads these files into its prompt library, which is
 *   invoked with `@` (`@opsx-propose`), so its adapter declares that prefix.
 *
 * Deriving the name from `getFilePath` keeps generated cross-references and
 * onboarding hints in step with the files OpenSpec actually writes. A
 * hand-maintained list drifted before: only OpenCode was rewritten when the
 * hyphen form was introduced (#727), and Cursor still advertised `/opsx:`
 * commands its palette never registered (#1307). Carrying the prefix as
 * adapter metadata rather than inferring it keeps the one tool that does not
 * use a slash from being advertised as if it did.
