# CLI Archive Command Specification

## Purpose
The archive command moves completed changes from the active changes directory to the archive folder with date-based naming, following OpenSpec conventions.

## Command Syntax
```bash
openspec archive [change-name] [--yes|-y]
```

Options:
- `--yes`, `-y`: Skip confirmation prompts (for automation)
## Requirements
### Requirement: Change Selection

The command SHALL support both interactive and direct change selection methods.

#### Scenario: Interactive selection

- **WHEN** no change-name is provided
- **THEN** display interactive list of available changes (excluding archive/)
- **AND** allow user to select one

#### Scenario: Direct selection

- **WHEN** change-name is provided
- **THEN** use that change directly
- **AND** validate it exists

#### Scenario: No change name and no answer available

- **WHEN** no change-name is provided and the selection prompt cannot be answered
- **THEN** report that a change name is required
- **AND** state that no answer could be read from stdin
- **AND** suggest a rerun naming the change and passing `--yes`
- **AND** exit with a non-zero status code rather than reporting success for a run that archived nothing

### Requirement: Task Completion Check

The command SHALL verify task completion status before archiving to prevent premature archival.

#### Scenario: Incomplete tasks found

- **WHEN** incomplete tasks are found (marked with `- [ ]`)
- **THEN** display all incomplete tasks to the user
- **AND** prompt for confirmation to continue
- **AND** default to "No" for safety

#### Scenario: All tasks complete

- **WHEN** all tasks are complete OR no tasks.md exists
- **THEN** proceed with archiving without prompting

### Requirement: Archive Process

The archive operation SHALL follow a structured process to safely move changes to the archive.

#### Scenario: Performing archive

- **WHEN** archiving a change
- **THEN** execute these steps:
  1. Create archive/ directory if it doesn't exist
  2. Generate target name as `YYYY-MM-DD-[change-name]` using current date, keeping the name as-is when it already starts with a `YYYY-MM-DD-` prefix
  3. Claim the target and verify that it does not already exist
  4. Prepare and validate spec updates from the active change's delta specs
  5. Apply the spec updates as a rollback-capable transaction
  6. Move the entire change directory to the archive location
  7. If a spec mutation or final move fails before a complete archive is secured, restore the spec transaction and leave or return the change at its active path
  8. If a verified fallback copy completes but staged-source cleanup fails, retain the complete archive and committed spec state for recovery instead of risking the only complete copy

#### Scenario: Archive already exists

- **WHEN** target archive already exists
- **THEN** fail with error message
- **AND** do not overwrite existing archive

#### Scenario: Successful archive

- **WHEN** move succeeds
- **THEN** display success message with archived name and list of updated specs

### Requirement: Spec Update Process

After claiming the archive destination, the command SHALL apply delta changes to main specs to reflect the deployed reality, then move the change to its archive destination. It SHALL restore the spec transaction when a mutation or final move fails before a complete archive is secured. Once a verified fallback archive is complete, a staged-source cleanup failure SHALL retain that archive and committed spec state for recovery.

#### Scenario: Applying delta changes

- **WHEN** archiving a change with delta-based specs
- **THEN** parse and apply delta changes as defined in openspec-conventions
- **AND** validate all operations before applying

#### Scenario: Validating delta changes

- **WHEN** processing delta changes
- **THEN** perform validations as specified in openspec-conventions
- **AND** if validation fails, show specific errors and abort

#### Scenario: Conflict detection

- **WHEN** applying deltas would create duplicate requirement headers
- **THEN** abort with error message showing the conflict
- **AND** suggest manual resolution

#### Scenario: Duplicate requirement already exists in the main spec

- **WHEN** a main spec contains two canonical requirement headers with the same name
- **THEN** reject the structurally ambiguous main spec before applying any delta
- **AND** preserve the main spec and active change unchanged

#### Scenario: New main spec inherits the delta's Purpose

- **WHEN** a delta creates a main spec that does not exist yet
- **AND** the delta spec has a line-initial `## Purpose` header that is not inside a fenced code block or an HTML comment
- **AND** the section body, ignoring fenced blocks and HTML comments, is not empty
- **THEN** write the section body into the new main spec, trimmed but otherwise verbatim, fenced code blocks included
- **AND** the section body runs to the next `## ` heading outside a fenced block

#### Scenario: New main spec without an authored Purpose

- **WHEN** a delta creates a main spec that does not exist yet
- **AND** the delta spec has no such `## Purpose` header, or that section's body is empty once fenced blocks and HTML comments are ignored
- **THEN** write the TBD placeholder Purpose naming the change to update after archive

#### Scenario: Delta Purpose that would leave the new main spec unreadable

- **WHEN** a delta creates a main spec that does not exist yet
- **AND** carrying its `## Purpose` body over would leave a spec that reads differently to different readers - a heading or requirement header that truncates a section, an unterminated code fence that swallows one, or any HTML comment, which the section scan skips but the file keeps
- **THEN** write the TBD placeholder Purpose instead and warn that the delta Purpose was ignored
- **AND** complete the archive rather than aborting it

#### Scenario: Carried Purpose shorter than the strict-mode minimum

- **WHEN** the Purpose parsed back out of the new main spec is shorter than the minimum Purpose length strict validation enforces
- **THEN** carry it over unchanged and warn that `openspec validate --strict` reports it as too brief

#### Scenario: Delta Purpose for a capability that already has a main spec

- **WHEN** a delta carries a `## Purpose` and the target main spec already exists
- **THEN** leave the existing Purpose untouched
- **AND** warn that the delta Purpose was ignored, naming the spec file to edit directly, but only when that spec has a Purpose of its own and it differs from the delta's

### Requirement: Capability Retirement

A delta whose REMOVED entries cover every requirement a capability has SHALL retire that capability instead of writing a main spec with no requirements, which can never pass validation.

#### Scenario: Deciding that a rebuilt spec cannot be written

- **WHEN** applying a delta leaves the rebuilt spec with no requirement blocks, and every other nonblank line in the whole file is accounted for as the title, Purpose, Requirements header, or a canonical requirement's statement, scenarios, or fenced examples
- **THEN** put that rebuilt spec to the spec validator
- **AND** treat it as retirable only when its sole validation error is that the spec has no requirements
- **AND** otherwise write or reject it exactly as any other rebuilt spec, so a spec the validator still accepts, one broken in some further way, and one still holding a `###` heading are all left alone

#### Scenario: Validation was skipped

- **WHEN** the archive runs with validation disabled
- **THEN** retire nothing, because no verdict was produced to justify a deletion
- **AND** write the rebuilt spec exactly as an archive without this behavior would

#### Scenario: Retirement is not declared

- **WHEN** a rebuilt spec is retirable but the change does not declare `retire_capabilities: true` in its metadata, or declares it in metadata that cannot be honored
- **THEN** write the spec as any other, so the archive aborts on it exactly as it did before this behavior existed
- **AND** name the marker as the fix in that abort, and say when a marker that is present cannot be honored
- **AND** say nothing about the marker when retiring would not have made the spec writable anyway

#### Scenario: Delta removes the capability's last requirement

- **WHEN** a retirable rebuilt spec belongs to a capability whose main spec exists
- **AND** at least one requirement was actually removed by this run
- **AND** the change declares `retire_capabilities: true`
- **THEN** delete the capability's `spec.md` instead of writing it
- **AND** refuse to delete when the target resolves outside the real specs root
- **AND** delete any in-root directory the deletion leaves empty, and never the specs root itself
- **AND** count every operation the delta applied in the archive totals
- **AND** record the retirement in the archive warnings, naming what the deleted file held and giving a pasteable Git recovery command only when the spec lived in the caller's checkout

#### Scenario: Retirement is deferred until every spec is written

- **WHEN** an archive both retires one capability and updates another
- **THEN** settle the archive destination before touching any spec, so a name collision cannot strand a retirement
- **AND** perform the deletion only after every spec write has succeeded
- **AND** report a destination claimed while the merge ran as the same collision, rather than as a raw filesystem error

#### Scenario: Capability directory holds other files

- **WHEN** retiring a capability whose directory still holds other files after `spec.md` is deleted
- **THEN** leave that directory in place

#### Scenario: Removal was already synced

- **WHEN** a retirable rebuilt spec removed nothing this run and its main spec exists
- **THEN** leave the file untouched
- **AND** abort the archive with the validation error, as for any other unwritable spec, unless validation was skipped

#### Scenario: Content the merge cannot account for

- **WHEN** the spec holds any non-blank line the merge cannot name - anywhere in the file, including above the requirements section and inside a requirement block, where content the parser did not read as a new header rides along
- **THEN** refuse the retirement, because deleting the file would take that content with it
- **AND** say which lines stood in the way when the change declared the marker, rather than aborting on the bare validation error

#### Scenario: Main spec is already gone

- **WHEN** a REMOVED-only delta targets a capability that has no main spec, and the change declares `retire_capabilities: true`
- **THEN** complete the archive without creating or retiring one

### Requirement: Confirmation Behavior

The spec update confirmation SHALL provide clear visibility into changes before they are applied.

#### Scenario: Displaying confirmation

- **WHEN** prompting for confirmation
- **THEN** display a clear summary showing:
  - Which specs will be created (new capabilities)
  - Which specs will be updated (existing capabilities)
  - The source path for each spec
- **AND** format the confirmation prompt as:
  ```
  The following specs will be updated:
  
  NEW specs to be created:
    - cli-archive (from changes/add-archive-command/specs/cli-archive/spec.md)
  
  EXISTING specs to be updated:
    - cli-init (from changes/update-init-command/specs/cli-init/spec.md)
  
  Update 2 specs and archive 'add-archive-command'? [y/N]:
  ```
#### Scenario: Handling confirmation response

- **WHEN** waiting for user confirmation
- **THEN** default to "No" for safety (require explicit "y" or "yes")
- **AND** skip confirmation when `--yes` or `-y` flag is provided

#### Scenario: User declines confirmation

- **WHEN** user declines the confirmation
- **THEN** abort the entire archive operation
- **AND** display message: "Archive cancelled. No changes were made."
- **AND** exit with non-zero status code

### Requirement: Error Conditions

The command SHALL handle various error conditions gracefully.

#### Scenario: Handling errors

- **WHEN** errors occur
- **THEN** handle the following conditions:
  - Missing openspec/changes/ directory
  - Change not found
  - Archive target already exists
  - File system permissions issues
  - A confirmation prompt that cannot be answered because no answer can be read from stdin

#### Scenario: Confirmation cannot be answered

- **WHEN** a confirmation prompt fails because no answer can be read from stdin
- **THEN** report which decision needed an answer
- **AND** suggest a rerun that adds `--yes` and reproduces the flags the caller already passed
- **AND** make no filesystem change
- **AND** exit with a non-zero status code

#### Scenario: Cancellation is not treated as a missing answer

- **WHEN** the user cancels a prompt with Ctrl-C
- **THEN** treat it as a cancellation rather than an unanswerable prompt
- **AND** preserve the existing cancellation behavior

### Requirement: Skip Specs Option

The archive command SHALL support a `--skip-specs` flag that skips all spec update operations and proceeds directly to archiving.

#### Scenario: Skipping spec updates with flag

- **WHEN** executing `openspec archive <change> --skip-specs`
- **THEN** skip spec discovery and update confirmation
- **AND** proceed directly to moving the change to archive
- **AND** display a message indicating specs were skipped

### Requirement: Non-blocking confirmation

The archive operation SHALL proceed when the user declines spec updates instead of cancelling the entire operation.

#### Scenario: User declines spec update confirmation

- **WHEN** the user declines spec update confirmation
- **THEN** skip spec updates
- **AND** continue with the archive operation
- **AND** display a success message indicating specs were not updated

### Requirement: Display Output

The command SHALL provide clear feedback about delta operations.

#### Scenario: Showing delta application

- **WHEN** applying delta changes
- **THEN** display for each spec:
  - Number of requirements added
  - Number of requirements modified
  - Number of requirements removed
  - Number of requirements renamed
- **AND** use standard output symbols (+ ~ - →) as defined in openspec-conventions:
  ```
  Applying changes to specs/user-auth/spec.md:
    + 2 added
    ~ 3 modified
    - 1 removed
    → 1 renamed
  ```

### Requirement: Archive Validation

The archive command SHALL validate changes before applying them to ensure data integrity.

#### Scenario: Pre-archive validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec archive change-name`
- **THEN** validate the change structure first
- **AND** only proceed if validation passes
- **AND** show validation errors if it fails

#### Scenario: Proposal warnings stay proposal-level

- **WHEN** archiving a change
- **THEN** the non-blocking proposal warnings SHALL NOT repeat requirement-level
  issues reached through the delta specs
- **AND** a requirement removed by a `## REMOVED Requirements` delta SHALL NOT be
  reported as missing a scenario
- **AND** proposal-level issues SHALL still be reported

#### Scenario: Force archive without validation

- **WHEN** executing `openspec archive change-name --no-validate`
- **THEN** skip validation (unsafe mode)
- **AND** show warning about skipping validation

## Why These Decisions

**Interactive selection**: Reduces typing and helps users see available changes
**Task checking**: Prevents accidental archiving of incomplete work
**Date prefixing**: Maintains chronological order and prevents naming conflicts; a name that already carries a date prefix keeps it, so archived names never stack dates
**No overwrite**: Preserves historical archives and prevents data loss
**Claim-first transaction**: The destination is claimed before main specs are mutated, spec changes are rollback-protected, and the active change is moved only after the spec transaction succeeds
**Confirmation for spec updates**: Provides visibility into what will change, prevents accidental overwrites, and ensures users understand the impact before specs are modified
**--yes flag for automation**: Allows CI/CD pipelines to archive without interactive prompts while maintaining safety by default for manual use
