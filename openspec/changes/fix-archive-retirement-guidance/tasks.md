# Tasks

## 1. Name the blocking content when the marker is absent
- [x] 1.1 Derive "this run emptied the capability" once, and hint on it in both the marker-missing and content-blocked cases
- [x] 1.2 Keep the marker unnamed while content still blocks the retirement, while still reporting one that cannot be honored

## 2. Render the blocking lines safely
- [x] 2.1 Replace control characters and bound each line, sharing one helper with the marker-declared refusal
- [x] 2.2 Sanitize the marker's own reason at its source, so `validate` is covered too
- [x] 2.3 Cover the human abort, the `--json` detail, and the rendering with tests

## 3. Record the behavior
- [x] 3.1 Update the `cli-archive` spec delta and `docs/writing-specs.md`
